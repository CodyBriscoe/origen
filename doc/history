* Fixed performance regression when generating multiple patterns back-back. This was caused by querying
  Git for workspace status info for every pattern, this is now cached after the first call.
* Some application file cleanup:
  * config/users.rb is now ignored and can be removed, a different API may be introduced in future to
    define an application's user list
  * config/development.rb will no longer be generated for new plugins and is considered deprecated, though
    for now it will continue to be loaded when present
  * config/environment.rb has been renamed to config/boot.rb to differentiate it from environment files.
    In this case of a plugin this is only loaded when the plugin is running from its own workspace, so
    it can be used to replace config/development.rb
* General improvements to the controller API, added more tests for it.
* The failing stacktrace shown in the console now only shows callers from within the current application.
  Previous behavior that would show the complete trace (including calls in plugins and Origen core) can
  be restored by running with --verbose.
* A proc can now be assigned as a target to use some custom code rather than a target file, this is
  mainly intended to used within tests:

~~~ruby
Origen.target.temporary = -> { $dut = SomeLocalClass.new }

 # Any calls to load or reload the target will now execute the above function
~~~

* Multiple sub\_block instances are now supported, this includes various ways to define the
  base\_addresses as shown in the example below:

~~~ruby
class Top
  include Origen::TopLevel

  def initialize
    sub\_block  :vreg, class\_name: "VReg", base\_address: 0x1000\_0000
    sub\_blocks :atd, instances: 2, class\_name: "ATD", base\_address: 0x2000\_0000
    sub\_blocks :osc, instances: 2, class\_name: "Oscillator", base\_address: 0x3000\_0000, base\_address\_step: 0x1000
    sub\_blocks :pmc, instances: 2, class\_name: "PMC", base\_address: [0x4000\_0000, 0x4001\_0000]
  end
end

dut = Top.new
# The given instance is accessible by appending the index number to the sub\_block name
dut.atd0      # => <ATD instance>
dut.atd1      # => <ATD instance>
# Append an 's' to the name to get an array of all instances
dut.atds      # => [<ATD instance>, <ATD instance>]

dut.vreg.base\_address  # => 0x1000\_0000
dut.atd0.base\_address  # => 0x2000\_0000
dut.atd1.base\_address  # => 0x2000\_0000
dut.osc0.base\_address  # => 0x3000\_0000
dut.osc1.base\_address  # => 0x3000\_1000
dut.pmc0.base\_address  # => 0x4000\_0000
dut.pmc1.base\_address  # => 0x4001\_0000

a -c option to enable coverage.

Various enhancements:

* Single page web deploy to Git is now supported via "origen web compile path/to/template -r"
* The current user's Git profile to identify their name and email address unless otherwise
  defined.
* Added support for Google analytics in generated web pages, add the tracking ID to the front
  matter of the given page/layout to track it:

~~~text
---
title: My Page
analytics: UA-12345678-1
---

### My Page
~~~

* No layout can now be specified if the application wants to handle a complete web page layout.
  When no layout is specified the page will not be wrapped with Origen's bootstrap or any
  other template.

~~~text 
---
layout: None
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  ...
~~~

* Updated web page layout with Origen logo and footer.
* Regression commands now work with Git.
* Initial version of more powerful File diff utility has been added, in addition to reporting
  whether or not two files are different it will also generate a comparison file. (@priyavadan)

~~~ruby
left\_file = "#{Origen.root}/left.txt"
right\_file = "#{Origen.root}/right.txt"
processor = Origen::Utility::FileDiff::Processor.new(left\_file, right\_file)

# To Generate a HTML file (diff.html) showing the differences
Origen::Utility::FileDiff::Formatter::Html.new(processor.process!, "#{Origen.root}/diff.html").format

# To Generate a TXT file (diff.txt) showing the differences
Origen::Utility::FileDiff::Formatter::Text.new(processor.process!, "#{Origen.root}/diff.txt").format
~~~

* Various improvements to the Git driver.

'origen web compile' can now deploy to a Git repository as well as to a Linux web server
directory.

To deploy to Git, setup your application config to point to the required Git repo like
this:

~~~ruby
config.web\_directory = "git@github.com:Origen-SDK/Origen-SDK.github.io.git"
config.web\_domain = "http://origen-sdk.org"
~~~

A single Git repo can host many sites by deploying to a sub-directory like this:

~~~ruby
config.web\_directory = "git@github.com:Origen-SDK/Origen-SDK.github.io.git/doc\_helpers"
config.web\_domain = "http://origen-sdk.org/doc\_helpers"
~~~

Version archiving is currently not supported with Git deploy, an alternative way of
archiving old documentation snapshots may emerge in future.
