This guide provides advice on how to create new application workspaces and how to
safely update your application's dependencies.

This advice is particularly critical when running in a corporate Linux environment where
the Linux distribution is older and/or you don't have permission to write to the
system Ruby installation.

#### Creating a New Workspace

Creating a new workspace means setting up an existing application within a new directory
for the first time.

The most important thing to remember in this case is to **always run <code>origen -v</code>
as the first step after importing the application files from your revision control system.**

Doing this ensures that Origen provides some basic configuration of [Bundler](<%= path "guides/installation/gems" %>)
which will ensure that it runs well within a restricted corporate environment.

After doing this for the first time, you can then safely run the <code>bundle</code> command
directly if you want to.

#### Updating Dependencies

Updating dependencies means changing the version of a given gem/plugin within your Gemfile
or .gemspec.

In some cases (depending on what gems you already have installed locally), you can simply make
the edit and then continue running the <code>origen</code> command without any problems.

If you don't already have the gem version installed locally, you may get a [Bundler](<%= path "guides/installation/gems" %>)
error which may or may not clearly describe the problem.

In most cases, this can be resolve by running the following command, telling Bundler which gem you
just changed the version of:

~~~text
> bundle update <gem_name>

// For example, say you just changed the version of the origen_testers gem, then run:
> bundle update origen_testers
~~~

If that doesn't work, then the following command will completely re-build your gem bundle and pull in the
latest versions of all gems which satisfy the rules defined in your Gemfile, solving any dependency conflict
issues in the process:

~~~text
> bundle update
~~~

### Workspace Size Considerations

By default, all downloaded dependencies are placed in the <code>home_dir</code>, which is likely pointing to
<code>~/.origen/gems</code>. However, gems can be large,
and bigger projects (or working on several unrelated projects) means that the <code>gems</code> directory can
quickly swell in size. This can be problematic particularly on corporate Linux systems, which usually do not
have sufficient home directories to handle the size and quantity of gems we are dealing with. There are a few
ways to deal with this.

#### Bundle Clean

Bundler comes with its own clean-up command. Running <code>bundle clean</code> when inside
of an application will remove all of the 'unused' gems currently taking up space, where 'unused' gems are defined
as gems not currently being used by the <u>current</u> application. This can be a quick solution if you know that you have
several old, outdated gems that will likely never be used again. The only down side being other applications
will require you to reinstall gems that running <code>bundle clean</code> deleted.

You can see bundler's own documentation on this feature by running <code>bundler clean -h</code> at your
console, or be visiting the [bundler docs](https://bundler.io/v1.16/man/bundle-clean.1.html).

##### Relocating Your Gems

Individually, you can control where your gems are installed by using either the [site configs](<%= path "guides/installation/company/" %>),
or by setting an <code>environment variable</code>. This will build or rebuild all of your gems at that
location, which is generally a project drive or somewhere else where space is less of an issue.

You can set the site config variable <code>user_gem_dir</code> to point to the new location that you
wish your gems to be installed at. Alternatively, you can set the <code>environment variable</code>
<code>ORIGEN_USER_GEM_DIR</code> to accomplish the same in a more 'linux-like' way. Recall from the
[site config page](<%= path "guides/installation/company/" %>) that environment variables will overrule
site config variables.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Info!</strong> This will only move the location of the downloaded gems. It will not change the
  full install directory, meaning that your <a href='<%= path "guides/misc/session/" %>'>Origen session</a>, 
  logs, and <a href='<%= path "guides/installation/invoking/" %>'>global Gemfile</a> will stay in your <code>home_dir</code>.
  These items are small, and should not fill up even a minimal, corporate Linux home directory. For details on
  moving this as well, please see the <a href='<%= path "guides/advanced/invocations/" %>'>advanced topic here</a>.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> If you are doing this inside of an application, you will need to remove the
  <code>.bundle</code> and <code>lbin</code> directories to see this take effect. These store links and
  configuration settings to your original gems directory. Don't worry though, Origen will rebuid them for you,
  with the updated gem directory this time.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Deprecation Warning!</strong> To support older applications, the site variable <code>gem_install_dir</code>
  and its <code>environment variable</code> counterpart <code>ORIGEN_GEM_INSTALL_DIR</code> are still valid. However, these fulfill the same
  purpose as <code>user_gem_dir</code>, with <code>user_gem_dir</code> taking precedence.
</div>

#### Tool Repo (TR) Directories

Origen supports setting up <code>Tool Repository</code> gem builds. This is considered an advance topic, and can
be difficult to implement unless you are familiar with Origen's boot process and site configs, but it mentioned
here as being an effective means for advanced users or project managers to oversee a group of user's gem
install directories. For additional details, please see the 
[advanced topic on invoking Origen](<%= path "guides/advanced/invocations/#Site_Config_For_Toolset_Installations" %>).

### Configuring the Home Directory Location

The previous section is an example of using the site config to manage your <code>gems</code> workspace. However,
there's more to the workspace than just the <code>gems</code> directory.

The workspace is divided into three sections:

1. The Origen Home Directory: Essentially Origen's scratch space.
2. The User's Installation Directory: Location where user installation customizations can be found.
3. The User Gem Directory: Location to install the gems.

The above list is a top-down listing of the sections, but we'll actually discuss in detail from the bottom-up view.
Each of the sections can be customized using the [site config](<%= path "guides/installation/company/" %>).

#### Evaluating Paths

Before we get started, the variables <code>user_gem_dir</code>, <code>user_install_dir</code>, and <code>home_dir</code>
will be evaluated as <code>paths</code>, meaning that there's some magic that happens between what you type into the
site config, and what actually gets used. This involves:

* The <code>~</code> means <code>username</code>. For example, if I'm logged in as <code>coreyeng</code>, the path
<code>/proj/~/my_origen</code> becomes <code>/proj/coreyeng/my_origen</code>.
* The path is evaluated per Ruby's <a href='https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/File.html#method-c-expand_path'>File.expand_path</a>.
Meaning that a leading <code>~/</code> becomes
<code>/home/coreyeng</code> or <code>C:/users/coreyeng</code> (or whatever your OS evaluates <code>~/</code> to).
* Not starting the path with either <code>~/</code> or <code>/</code> is a relative path, where the current path is
prepended. For example, running from <code>/proj/my_project</code> and using <code>origen/~</code> becomes
<code>/proj/my_project/origen/coreyeng</code>.
* You can escape the <code>~</code> using the <code>\</code> symbol.
* If the path provided already ends with the <code>append_dot_origen</code> or <code>append_gems</code>, then those
will not be reapplied (<code>append_dot_origen</code> and <code>append_gems</code> will be covered in the next section).

#### User Gem Directory

The <code>user gem directory</code> indicates where the gems should be installed. Moving this directory around will
change where <code>Bundler</code> places all of your gems.

There are three site config variables to consider. Below are those variables as well as some examples of how to use them.

<strong>Default:</strong> If no <code>user_gem_dir</code> is specified, the gem directory falls back to <code>home_dir</code>.

~~~yaml
# By default, user_gem_dir defaults to wherever the home directory is.
# origen_site_config.yml
append_dot_origen: true # Appends .origen to the path
append_gems: true       # Appends gems to the path
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/home/<username>/.origen/gems'
~~~

##### Move the user_gem_dir

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
user_gem_dir: /proj/my_gems/
append_dot_origen: true
append_gems: true
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/my_gems/.origen/gems'
~~~

##### Set append_dot_origen and append_gems to false to have them removed

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
user_gem_dir: /proj/my_gems/~
append_dot_origen: false
append_gems: false
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/my_gems/<username>'
~~~

##### Set append_dot_origen and append_gems to custom values to have the moved

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
user_gem_dir: /proj/my_gems/
append_dot_origen: my_workspace
append_gems: .my_gems
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/my_gems/my_workspace/.my_gems'
~~~

To review quickly, you can move the install directory for the gems by moving </code>user_gem_dir</code>. By default,
this will automatically append <code>.origen/gems</code> to the directory path, unless <code>append_dot_origen</code>
and <code>append_gems</code> specify otherwise.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Deprecation Warning!</strong> This warning from the previous section is repeated here:
  To support older applications, the site variable <code>gem_install_dir</code>
  and its <code>environment variable</code> counterpart <code>ORIGEN_GEM_INSTALL_DIR</code> are still valid. However, these fulfill the same
  purpose as <code>user_gem_dir</code>, with <code>user_gem_dir</code> taking precedence.
</div>

#### User Installation Directory

The <code>user_install_dir</code> indicates where the user's customization settings are located. Right now, this
only includes where the global <code>Gemfile</code> can be located, but <code>site configs</code> can also be
located there. Future user customization settings will also use this directory location.

<strong>Default:</strong> If no <code>user_install_dir</code> is specified, the <code>home_dir</code> is used instead.

~~~yaml
# Default
# origen_site_config.yml
append_dot_origen: true # Appends .origen to the path.
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/home/<username>/.origen'
~~~

##### Move the user_install_dir

~~~yaml
append_dot_origen: true
user_install_dir: /proj/~/install
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/<username>/install/.origen'
~~~

##### Disable appending .origen

~~~yaml
# Note this also affects the user_gem_dir
append_dot_origen: false
user_install_dir: /proj/~/install
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/<username>/install'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/<username>/install/gems'
~~~

##### Customize the appended directory

~~~yaml
# Note this also affects the user_gem_dir
append_dot_origen: my_origen
user_install_dir: /proj/~/install
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/<username>/install/my_origen'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/<username>/install/my_origen/gems'
~~~

#### Home Directory

The <code>home_dir</code> takes care of everything else. In general, this acts as Origen's scratch space. For example,
the <code>LSF logs</code> and the <code>global session</code> are stored in this location.

<strong>Default</strong>: if no <code>home_dir</code> is specified, it defaults to <code>~/<code>, which will be expand
to your home directory (for example, <code>/home/coreyeng</code> on Linux, or <code>C:\users\coreyeng</code> on
Windows).

<code>home_dir</code> is also the topmost path. So, if <code>user_install_dir</code> and/or <code>user_gem_dir</code>
are not defined, they default back to <code>home_dir</code>.

##### If no home_dir is specified, ~/ is used

~~~ruby
# Default

# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.home_dir #=> '/home/<username>/.origen'
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/home/<username>/.origen'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/home/<username>/.origen/gems'
~~~

##### Move the home_dir

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
home_dir: /proj/origens/~
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.home_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.origen'
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.origen'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.origen/gems'
~~~

##### Move the home_dir and disable append_dot_origen

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
home_dir: /proj/origens/~
append_dot_origen: false
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.home_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>'
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/gems'
~~~

##### Move the home_dir and change append_dot_origen

~~~yaml
# origen_site_config.yml
home_dir: /proj/origens/~
append_dot_origen: .my_origen
~~~

~~~ruby
# In interactive session
Origen.site_config.home_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.my_origen'
Origen.site_config.user_install_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.my_origen'
Origen.site_config.user_gem_dir #=> '/proj/origens/<username>/.my_origen/gems'
~~~

#### Closing Thoughts

The purpose of having all these site configs variables is to allow full customization when desired, but be able to simplify
common usages. For example, if you want to move your entire <code>.origen</code> from your home directory to some
project directory, you only need to move <code>home_dir</code>. Everything else will go with it. But, if you want to
leave your custom user setup and be able to get all the logs and global session in your home directory but just move
where all your gems are stored, you can do that too.
