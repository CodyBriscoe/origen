Origen enables easy and wide reaching code re-use via its Plugin system.

The plugin system enables models, controllers, drivers and any other Origen-based IP
to be shared between multiple
applications while maintaining a single centralized point of ownership
and development.

The [Plugins Directory](<%= path "plugins" %>) can be consulted to
review what plugins are currently available for use by your application.

Plugins allow any code from the lib directory, any templates,
any pattern or program sources files, or any custom commands
to be shared between applications.

Therefore plugins can be constructed to share DUT models, test program
interfaces, documentation layouts, VB or C code snippets, entirely
new Origen commands, etc., etc.
