### What is a 'Remote'?

In some cases, your application may require access to external data that is 
kept under revision control but not necessarily as part of the Origen environment.
For example, you may need access to a design file that is stored with the IP and rather than store
a static copy in the application vault, you want to easy populate a local version based on a 
specified tag.  Then what you need is an Origen Remote.

### How to Populate a Remote

Populating a remote is extremely easy, all that has to be done is to define
the required remote within the <code>config/application.rb</code> file.

Three details are required:

* <code>dir</code>: The sub-directory within the Origen remotes workspace where you want the population to occur, (aka. local)
* <code>vault</code> or <code>rc_url</code>: The path to the vault/repo, 'vault' and 'rc_url' can be used interchangeably
* <code>version</code>: The version, or tag, that you want to use

Once in possession of these details add them to the <code>config.remotes</code>
attribute. 
This accepts an array and any number of remotes can be added, here is an example
that populates two remotes:

~~~ruby
config.remotes = [
  {
    dir: "source/include/v_ip_ate",
    vault: "sync://sync-15000:15000/v_ip_ate/compiler/include",
    version: "v1.0.1",
  },
  {
    dir: "artwork",
    rc_url: "git@github.com:Origen-SDK/artwork.git",
    version: "master",
    development: true
  }
]
~~~

Origen will populate all remotes defined by a top-level application. It will also populate all
remotes defined by an application's plugins, except for those which have been marked with
`development: true` as in the 2nd example above.

Setting `development: true`, indicates to Origen that the remote is only required when developing
the plugin within a standalone workspace, and that it is not required when the plugin is being
used by a top-level application.

#### Location

Population of the remotes will occur within the remotes workspace located at the top-level 
of the receiving application.  For instance, in the above example, the v_ip_ate remote would be
located at:

~~~code
.<top>_remotes_DO_NOT_HAND_MODIFY/source/include/v_ip_ate
~~~

Please note that the value of <code>dir</code> must be unique for each remote within the application.

You can get a handle on the top-level remotes dir via the helper <code>Origen.app.remotes_dir</code>, as shown
in this example:
  
~~~ruby
data = File.read("#{Origen.app.remotes_dir}/source/include/v_ip_ate")
~~~
  
#### Origen Does the Rest

With those details added Origen will then take care of ensuring that the dependencies
are fulfilled every time that the application is invoked.


#### Setting up a Remote Development Environment

If you are still developing some parts of your remote, your environment setup may need to be slightly
different vs. working on a known good remote.  You can configure the receiving application to use
a development workspace like this:

~~~ruby
config.remotes = [
  {
    dir: "source/include/v_ip_ate",
    vault: "sync://sync-15000:15000/v_ip_ate_c90lp/compiler/include",
    version: "v0.0.0.dev2",
    path: "/proj/thao/build.22/common_vip/v_ip_ate",
  }
]
~~~

When a path reference is present Origen will override the vault/version reference and
will setup up a symbolic link from the regular
remote location to your development workspace - this means that the receiving application
is now always looking at your latest development code.

Origen will not allow the receiving application to be tagged when a path reference is active,
so you don't need to worry too much about forgetting to remove it!
