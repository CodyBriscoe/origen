The session store can be used to persist information (or state) across Origen threads
of execution within a given workspace.

Setting the current target with <code>origen t</code> is a example
of session information being used to setup some state that will persist into
future Origen commands that are executed within that workspace, while having no bearing on what happens
in other workspaces.

To access the session store:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session
~~~

The session is split into named stores which will be automatically created as soon as data
is added to them,
this gives application developers a namespace level to keep their data organized.

The namespace returns a key-value store containing all of the values in that namespace:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session.main      # => A key-value store
Origen.app.session.blah      # => A different key-value store
~~~

Plugin developers should use a store named after their plugin, for example the <code>ATDTest</code>
plugin would use:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session.atd_test  # => A key-value store for use by the ATDTest plugin
~~~

To store values to the session simply set them like this:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session.main[:exec_count] = 10
~~~

Unlike assigning values to a regular Hash variable, this value will survive between Origen
threads - go on fire up an <code>origen i</code> session and try it out:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session.main[:exec_count]    # => 10
~~~

Generally you can store hashes, arrays and even objects to the session although your
mileage-may-vary with particularly rich objects. Note that in the case of storing objects the class
definition must still be around when Origen tries to resurrect it from the session. i.e. you
cannot store an object, delete the class definition for that object, and then materialize it
from the session later. Similarly binary data cannot be stored to the session.

For now no API is provided to delete things from the session, although you can set values to nil:

~~~ruby
Origen.app.session.main[:exec_count] = nil
~~~

#### A Practical Example

In one of our applications, called 'NVM', there is a need to program firmware images
that are provided by the design team.

Rather than duplicate the firmware images in the design and test repositories they are typically
imported from the design repository into the test workspace at runtime (on as as-required
basis).
It is critical to keep track of what version of the firmware exists locally so
that if the production firmware version changes then the new version will be fetched, but if it
is the same as what is already there then the user is not made to wait for a redundant import operation.

In early Origen applications, significant logic had to be added to the application to implement
such a system, but the availability of the session store now makes this trivial:

~~~ruby
# Return the associated firmware file, this will automatically fetch the new version
# if the production firmware tag has changed since this was last called
def firmware_file
  path_to_local_file = "#{Origen.app.imports_dir}/firmware/production.hex"
  f = Pathname.new(path_to_local_file)
  if !f.exist? || Origen.app.session.nvm[:local_firmware_version] != production_tag
    # Clear this up front as we won't know what we will have if the checkout fails
    Origen.app.session.nvm[:local_firmware_version] = nil
    firmware_rc.checkout("production.hex", force: true, version: production_tag)
    Origen.app.session.nvm[:local_firmware_version] = production_tag
  end
  f
end

# Returns a revision controller to manage local import of firmware files
def firmware_rc
  @firmware_rc ||= Origen::RevisionControl.new remote: "sync://sync-15000:15000/nvm/firmware",
                                                local: "#{Origen.app.imports_dir}/firmware"
end
~~~
