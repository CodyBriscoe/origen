Every Origen thread will log output data to the console and to the files in the log directory.

Currently, Origen implements 5 types of logging messages and they can be called globally as shown below:

~~~ruby
  # INFO messages will always appear
  Origen.log.info "This is an INFO message." 
  # WARNING messages will always appear
  Origen.log.warn "This is a WARNING message."  
  # ERROR messages will always appear
  Origen.log.error "This is an ERROR message."  
  # DEPRECATE messages will always appear
  Origen.log.deprecate "This is a DEPRECATE message."  
  # DEBUG messages will only appear when logging verbosity level is set to 'VERBOSE'
  Origen.log.debug "This is a DEBUG message."    
~~~~

#### Logging Verbosity Levels

There are in total three verbosity levels, they are 'VERBOSE', 'QUIET' and 'SILENT'. These levels
only affect the output which appear on the console window, the log file will always capture everything
regardless of the verbosity level.

You can set logging verbosity level to 'VERBOSE' by adding '-verbose' to your Origen command line:

~~~text
origen compile templates/web/index.html.erb -verbose
~~~

When in verbose mode, Origen will output and store all 5 types of log messages to 
shell windows and log files.

To set verbosity level to 'QUIET', you simply just need to run Origen commands without the '-verbose' option:

~~~text
origen compile templates/web/index.html.erb 
~~~

When in quiet mode, Origen will NOT log any 'DEBUG' messages in the code either to shell window.

To set verbosity level to 'SILENT' run Origen commands with the '-silent' option:

~~~text
origen compile templates/web/index.html.erb -silent
~~~

When in silent mode, Origen will NOT output anything to the linux console window and will save
everything to the log file only.
