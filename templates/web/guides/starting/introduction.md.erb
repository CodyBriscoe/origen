Welcome to the Origen guides!

The Origen platform is written in Ruby
and following this documentation will take you from a complete beginner to an
Origen expert.

This site is focussed specifically on the Origen API, but for background on Ruby the
internet is your friend.
Ruby is very popular for web development and as such it is extremely easy to Google
for solutions to any Ruby-related problems that you may come across, or to find
tutorials from which to learn.

The official Ruby website contains a quick tutorial on Ruby to get you started:

* [Ruby in 20 Minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart)

Previous engineers who have learned Ruby have recommend the following resources:

* [Learn Ruby at rubymonk.com](https://rubymonk.com)
* [Learn Ruby at codeacademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
* [Ruby for Newbies Video Tutorials](http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/ruby-for-newbies/)
