There are some core concepts and terminology that should be understood up front in order for
the rest of the documentation to make sense.

##### Origen Application

An 'Origen Application' is an engineering application of some sort that has been built using the Origen
platform.

##### Origen Core

'Origen Core' refers to the Origen platform itself.
Although different applications may be using different versions of Origen core at any one time,
it does follow a single thread of development and the latest version should be able to support
any Origen application.

Origen core (or one of its plugins) should take care of all of the common tasks that are not application
specific. This means that an application developer should spend most of their time working
on things are unique to their particular application domain, and not worrying about how to open a file for
writing, or what the vector format for a given ATE is.

##### APIs

The term API stands for 'Application Programming Interface', which basically means a set of methods
that are exposed to the application to allow an engineer to programatically tell Origen what to do or build.

Origen provides various APIs for different functions such as to describe the registers within a model,
to generate pattern vectors, to build web pages, etc.

##### Plugins

The Origen platform provides a plugin system that allows 3rd parties to develop additional APIs to
supplement those provided by Origen core.
The Origen core team maintain a collection of important plugins which are considered extensions of
Origen core, but anyone in the community can create and share a plugin.

Application owners can control what versions of what plugins are used in their application.

Origen also has a mechanism for companies to maintain an internal plugin repository so that its plugin
system can be used to internally distribute proprietary code such as test blocks for a given silicon
technology.

##### Ruby

Ruby is the programming language that has been used to create Origen, all Origen applications are
also written in Ruby.

### Anatomy of an Origen Application

An Origen application is comprised of the following main components:

##### Models

Models are the foundation of an Origen application and encapsulate all meta-data about the silicon
object that they represent.
This can include but is not limited to: registers and bits, pins, and specs. 
Models can also instantiate other models, thereby allowing a full hierarchical representation of the target
device to be constructed.

The models also track state (while generating a test pattern for example), with the register and pin
objects behaving much like their silicon counterparts.

##### Controllers

Controllers are a concept used in test engineering applications, where each model is assigned
a controller that will be responsible for defining APIs to perform pattern operations based on the
given model.

For example, the controller for a analog-to-digital converter (ATD) model might define a 'convert'
method. This method would define
the sequence of register transactions that are required to do an ATD conversion.

A 'method' by the way, is simply a function that is associated with a given object in a object-oriented
programming language.

##### Drivers

Drivers, is the term generally used to refer to objects that control a protocol (e.g. JTAG) or some
piece of non-silicon hardware like a tester for example.

There is no dedicated Driver class in Origen and these will usually be constructed from the same
Origen APIs as used for Models and Controllers. Indeed the drivers could well be composed of a model
of the associated hardware and a controller for it.

##### Target

While your application could define many different models for different silicon products, the
only one that matters at any one time is the one that you are targeting - that is the one that the
given output should be compatible with or represent.

An application can have many targets where each one is responsible for instantiating a model (or models)
that represent a single runtime condition or context that Origen should apply when
generating content.

In test engineering applications, it is usual for the target to instantiate a single top-level
model called <code>$dut</code>, representing the device under test.

Generally the term 'target' is used to refer to the current combination of target + environment...

##### Environment

The environment can be thought of as a higher level target, which is used to define runtime setup that can
be used in conjunction with many different targets.

In test engineering applications, it is usual to use the environment to instantiate the target
test platform, normally this is assigned to the global variable <code>$tester</code>.

##### Templates

Origen has two main ways of generating dynamic ASCII output, the first is via the use of templates.
This is the most flexible way of generating dynamic content - the application provides a template
file which has been marked up with where dynamic content should go, Origen will then process it
within the context of the current target to generate a target specific version.

Origen does not care about what the template represents and it could be anything from design IP, to
web pages, to tool configuration files.

##### Sources

The second way of generating content is via APIs. In this case the generated content comes from
calling Origen methods via Ruby code, rather than from compiling a pre-written template.
For example, when creating a test
pattern the act of writing a register can be expressed via an API - <code>$dut.myreg.write!(0x5)</code> -
which will then be translated into the necessary vector stream by Origen.

The files which co-ordinate the APIs to build a specific output are called source files.

For test engineering applications, source files are used to describe patterns and test flows, though
Origen does also support a source-less approach to pattern generation based on the pattern name.
