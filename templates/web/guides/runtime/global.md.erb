Origen re-loads the runtime environment immediately before every pattern, test program or compile
job.
Therefore both the target and environment files can be used to set some global state that
will later be applied to all patterns or similar.

Note that you cannot actually generate any output from the target or environment, that will only
happen from within the pattern, program or template source files. However what you
can do is setup some initial state within your models to influence what will
be generated by the source files later.

In other words any changes that you make to the models after instantiating them
will persist into the remainder of the generation flow.
It is not recommended to put a lot of logic into target files, but when used
responsibly this can be a useful addition to your tool box. 

#### Origen Configuration

The target and environment files can also be used 
to override any Origen configuration settings that would otherwise be specified in
the <code>config/application.rb</code> file.

An example might be to set up product-specific [LSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF)
strings for utilization tracking:

~~~ruby
# target/eagle_1.rb
$dut = MyApp::Eagle.new(version: 1)

Origen.config.lsf.project =  "eagle.te"

# target/falcon_1.rb
$dut = MyApp::Falcon.new(version: 1)

Origen.config.lsf.project =  "falcon.te"
~~~

% end
