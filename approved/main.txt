main: This is a basic template example to test the RGen template compiler.
main: 
main: Verify that the target objects can be accessed:
main: 
main: Data: 0x5555
main: 
main: Verify that sub templates can be rendered and executed within their own context:
main: 
sub1: This is content from sub1
sub1: 
sub1: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
sub1: been influenced by the calling context:
sub1: 
sub1: Data: 0x0
sub1: 
sub1: No data value passed in!
main: Verify that import is an alias for render
main: 
sub1: This is content from sub1
sub1: 
sub1: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
sub1: been influenced by the calling context:
sub1: 
sub1: Data: 0x0
sub1: 
sub1: No data value passed in!
main: 
main: Rendering the template should not disrupt the current context, verify that the
main: data is still 0x5555:
main: 
main: Data: 0x5555
main: 
main: Verify that option data can be passed to rendered templates, the data
main: printed here should be 0x1234:
main: 
sub1: This is content from sub1
sub1: 
sub1: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
sub1: been influenced by the calling context:
sub1: 
sub1: Data: 0x0
sub1: 
sub1: Data values passed in: 0x1234
main: 
main: Again verify that the current context is still intact:
main: Data: 0x5555
main: 
main: Verify that templates from sub directories can be rendered:
main: 
sub2: This is content from sub2
sub2: 
sub2: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
sub2: been influenced by the calling context:
sub2: 
sub2: Data: 0x0
sub2: 
sub2: No data value passed in!
sub2: 
sub2: Verify that templates can render additional sub-templates:
sub2: 
sub3: This is content from sub3
sub3: 
sub3: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
sub3: been influenced by the calling context:
sub3: 
sub3: Data: 0x0
sub3: 
sub3: No data value passed in!
main: 
main: Again verify that the current context is still intact:
main: Data: 0x5555
main: 
main: Verify that no extra linebreaks are added:
sub4: This is a single line from sub4!
main: This should butt up against the sub 4 line
main: 
main: And that leading spaces are stripped, there should be
main: no leading whitespace before the sub 4 line:
sub4: This is a single line from sub4!
main: This is a test that helpers can compile templates inline

Hello
and goodbye
main: This is a test that indent works
          sub1: This is content from sub1
          sub1: 
          sub1: This data value should be 0 to prove that it has not
          sub1: been influenced by the calling context:
          sub1: 
          sub1: Data: 0x0
          sub1: 
          sub1: No data value passed in!
main: Verify by default that render will reload the target,
main: the value here should be blank
sub5: The value of dut.nvm.attribute_x is: 
main: Verify that target reload can optionally be inhibited,
main: the value here should be X
sub5: The value of dut.nvm.attribute_x is: X
